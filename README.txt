Welcome to My Games Page!

Here are some instructions for each game.

Game 1: Jaguar Puzzle
Simply drag and drop the pieces until they all match up and you can see the image clearly. 

Game 2: Chalk Lines
For this game you click the up/down/right/left buttons to position your arrow so that it 
doesn't run into the oncoming chalk lines. The longer you go, the higher your score!

Game 3: Ping Pong
Use your mouse to move your paddle (Green) up and down. Don't let that ball get past you!
Hint: Hitting the ball with the ends of the paddle will send the ball off in interesting
directions.



Current issues and future ideas:
Game 1: Jaguar Puzzle
I would like to have the pieces only select when you are on the visible parts of each, instead 
of the entire PNG. I also would like a snap-to function and some sort of congratulations when
the puzzle has been completed. 

Game 2: Chalk Lines
I would have liked to have had time to tie in the keyboard or mouse instead of being forced to
click the clunky buttons.

Game 3: Ping Pong
I wish I had had time to figure out an ending score function, like first to 10 wins or similar.
